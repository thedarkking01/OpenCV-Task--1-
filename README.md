# OpenCV Practice Tasks

Welcome to my OpenCV practice repository! This repository contains code snippets and tasks I have worked on to improve my understanding of image processing using OpenCV.

## Repository Contents

Below are the tasks covered in this repository:

1. **Read an Image**
   - Load an image using OpenCV and display it.

2. **Find Image Dimensions**
   - Extract and print the height, width, and number of channels of an image.

3. **Convert Image to Grayscale**
   - Convert a colored image into grayscale using OpenCV.

4. **Generate Negative of an Image**
   - Create a negative of an image by inverting its pixel values.

5. **Flip Image Vertically**
   - Flip an image along its vertical axis.

6. **Flip Image Horizontally**
   - Flip an image along its horizontal axis.

7. **Draw a Rectangle on an Image**
   - Draw a rectangle on an image at specified coordinates, with customizable color and thickness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with OpenCV. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/thedarkking01/OpenCV-Task--1-.git](https://github.com/thedarkking01/OpenCV-Task--1-)
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository:

   ```bash
   cd OpenCV-Task--1-
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts to execute individual tasks.

   ```bash
   python exam.ipynb
   ```

## Examples

Here are some example tasks and their outputs:

- **Grayscale Conversion:** Convert a colored image to grayscale for simplified processing.
- **Image Flipping:** Flip images vertically or horizontally for augmentation or perspective changes.
- **Draw Rectangle:** Highlight specific regions in an image using rectangles.
